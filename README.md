SwiftUI app with MVVM architecture.
-  All native libraries except for the Marquee
-  Infinite scrolling List (needs improvement)
-  Global Constants
-  API Manager
-  Custom components  - search bar and loader
-  Custom Font
-  Custom List Cells

#TODOs
- Refactor
- Documentation
- add SwiftData
- add accessibility
- figure out a better way to infinite scroll (ScrollView +  LazyVStack + onAppear is the best but also still bad option)
- add more styling
- persist the data more thoroughly and go deeper into pokemon stats
- implement fuzzy search
